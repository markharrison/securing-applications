# DevOps
 
![](images/11-devops.png)

DevOps is the engine that drives innovation – and reduces the time to deliver value.

A DevOps approach enables organizations to develop, deploy and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.

But DevOps is not just a product – it requires a culture of collaboration that is critical for DevOps to be successful.

In DevOps – we often discuss the inner and outer loop. The inner loop is the iterative process that a developer performs when they write, build and debug code. The outer loop is the build / deploy / monitoring and then driving the plan for subsequent development.
