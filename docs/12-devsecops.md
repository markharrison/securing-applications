# DevSecOps
 
![](images/12-devsecops.png)

DevSecOps is the evolution of DevOps.  It focusses on integrating security practises within the DevOps inner and outer loops to create a security first culture.

Furthermore, it mandates a shift left mentality - that is addressing security in the earliest stages in the development lifecycle. So not only is the development team thinking about building a high quality product efficiently, but they are also implementing security as they go.   

Addressing security earlier will improve the robustness, saves costs and accelerates delivery.
